# marketing-code-refactoring

## Description

The aim of this project is to make the website more accessible and clean up the html and css.

I have refractored the html and css, added semantic elements and commented the css.

The website is now accessible via the use of a screen reader and the code is ordered and easy to read.


## Installation

NA

## Usage

This website can be accessed as normal or with the use of a screenreader such as [JAWS](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/). The code can be accessed via DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), or right click your mouse and left click _inspect_ as per the screenshot below.
